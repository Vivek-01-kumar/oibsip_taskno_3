The objective of this project was to develop a linear regression model to predict a numerical outcome (price) based on a dataset with various features. This project provided practical experience in data collection, exploration, cleaning, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and visualization. Initially, we obtained a dataset containing numerical features and a target variable for prediction. To ensure data quality, we explored the dataset and confirmed there were no missing values. We performed descriptive statistics to understand data distribution and identify outliers.

Next, we identified relevant features that significantly contribute to the predictive model. These features included price, area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, mainroad, guestroom, basement, hotwaterheating, airconditioning, parking, prefarea, and furnishingstatus. We converted categorical features into binary format and normalized the dataset using MinMaxScaler to ensure that all features were on a similar scale.

We implemented linear regression using the Scikit-Learn library and evaluated the model’s performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) metrics. The model achieved an MSE of 1,754,318,687,330.6633 and an R² of 0.6529. These metrics indicate that approximately 65% of the variance in the target variable (price) can be explained by the model. We also extracted the coefficients for each feature, revealing their respective impact on the price prediction. The coefficients were as follows: area (2.359688e+02), bedrooms (7.677870e+04), bathrooms (1.094445e+06), stories (4.074766e+05), mainroad (3.679199e+05), guestroom (2.316100e+05), basement (3.902512e+05), hotwaterheating (6.846499e+05), airconditioning (7.914267e+05), parking (2.248419e+05), prefarea (6.298906e+05), semi-furnished (-1.268818e+05), and unfurnished (-4.136451e+05).

To visualize the model’s performance, we created a scatter plot comparing the actual and predicted values. The plot showed a reasonably good fit, with predicted values closely aligning with actual values. The linear regression model demonstrated a solid predictive capability with an R-squared value of 0.6529, indicating that approximately 65% of the variance in the target variable (price) can be explained by the model. However, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 1,754,318,687,330.6633 suggests there is room for improvement, potentially by incorporating more features, refining feature selection, or using more advanced regression techniques.
